# NESP TWQ 3.1.6 - Exploring WQ trading

## Description

The aim of the NESP Tropical Water Quality Hub Project 3.1.6 was to compare the cost of supplying DIN credits from various sources with the prices that
potential credit buyers would be willing to pay for those credits. This R-code estimates the minimum cost of supplying
DIN credits via fertiliser practice change in sugarcane production in the main Wet Tropics catchments (Daintree,
Mossman, Barron, Mulgrave-Russell, Johnstone, Tully, Murray and Herbert). Key data inputs on reductions in cane yield
and reductions in DIN loss from 563 individual cane land management units in the Wet Tropics are obtained
from the Queensland Government’s Paddock to Reef (P2R) modelling program. Data on fertiliser cost, sugar prices, sugar
content in cane, equipment cost and growers’ ‘transaction cost’ in engaging in water quality credit trading are obtained
from public sources and the literature. Results are produced in the form of estimated supply curves for DIN credits from
practice change in cane for the main Wet Tropics catchments.

## Code 
***File: P2R.data.reader.v041220 with Header.R*** 

This is a block of R code written for NESP Tropical Water Quality Hub Project 3.1.6. The software uses data supplied from 
the Queensland Government’s Paddock to Reef (P2R) modelling system, and other publicly available data, to generate plots 
of supply curves for water quality credits in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) for the main catchments in the Wet 
Tropics.
